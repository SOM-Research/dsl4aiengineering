DSL for Modeling AI Engineering Processes

Many modern software products embed AI components. As a result, their
development requires multidisciplinary teams with diverse skill sets.
Diversity may lead to communication issues or misapplication of best
practices. Process models, which prescribe how software should be
developed within an organization, can alleviate this problem.

In this paper, we introduce a domain-specific language for modeling AI
engineering processes. The DSL concepts stem from our analysis of
scientific and gray literature that describes how teams are developing
AI-based software. This DSL contributes a structured framework and a common
ground for designing, enacting and automating AI engineering processes.
